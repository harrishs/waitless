## waitLess

### waitLess is a wait list management application for restaurants, and soon other venues. 

#### waitLess uses Express and Node with a PostgreSQL database. Users can browse available restaurants, add or remove themselves from waitlists and check their wait time on those wait lists. Restaurants can activate or deactivate their wait list, update their wait list's wait time and add and remove customers from the wait list. As the users are added from the client side, the information is updated on the restaurant's side through socket.io.

Deployed On: https://waitless-lhl.herokuapp.com/
Other APIs used: Google Maps, Twilio on the restaurant side.
